    "description": "The Grateful Dead x Nike SB Dunk Low \u201cGreen Bear\u201d is one of three extremely sought after colorways from the California based rock band\u2019s collaboration with Nike SB. Nike SB produced a swarm of exciting new and original designs in 2020 that incorporate elements outside of the realm of sneaker culture, with the trio of Grateful Dead Dunks heading the lineup. The two-toned appearance of the upper features green faux fur on the toe, mid-panel, and heel as a direct reference to the band\u2019s marching bears characters commonly seen on various artworks for Grateful Dead albums and merchandise. The motif reappears in a multicolor design on the insole. Tonal suede overlays dot the forefoot, eyelets, and heel. Branding appears in the form of a contrasting blue jagged Swoosh on the mid-panel, blue Nike embroidery on the heel, and a mini marching bear and Swoosh logo inside of an emblem on the tongue. One final detail of note, the hidden stash pocket located on the inside of the tongue displays the band's \"Steal Your Face\" skull.",
